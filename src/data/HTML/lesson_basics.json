          "Welcome to the world of code! Last year, millions of learners from our community started with HTML. Why? HTML is the skeleton of all web pages. It’s often the first language learned by developers, marketers, and designers and is core to front-end development work. If this is your first time touching code, we’re excited for what you’re about to create. So what exactly is HTML? HTML provides structure to the content appearing on a website, such as images, text, or videos. Right-click on any page on the internet, choose “Inspect,” and you’ll see HTML in a panel of your screen.",
          "So what is the difference between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript? First of all, they can all be encapsulated within an HTML page, meaning that the browser starts by loading an HTML page, and only then it knows what to load from there.",
          "An HTML page is an HTML document that defines the content of the page by using a special markup similar to XML.A CSS stylesheet defines the style of the HTML elements in the page. It is either embeeded within an HTML page or loaded using the tag. JavaScript is the programming language used to interact with the HTML page through an API called the DOM (Document Object Model) Bindings. In other words, the DOM Bindings are the glue between the programming language and the HTML page that was initially loaded into the browser."
